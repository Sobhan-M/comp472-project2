    "We have 2 blocking vehicles, and the smallest constant would be 2. Therefore this heuristic gives us a value of 4. But we see that we can solve this puzzle in only 3 moves. B moves up for the first move. C moves up for the second move. Finally, A moves to the exit for the third move. This shows the heuristic is not admissible.\n",

    "- **h4:** This heuristic **_is admissible_**. The heuristic is designed to consider the distance of A to the exit to encourage moving A closer to the exit. This is because the other heuristics return a value of 0 even if we have not reached the goal state. This heuristic solves that issue by counting the distance to the exit cell and dividing it by 4. We divide by 4 to ensure admissibility, because we can move a maximum of 4 cells in a move. Therefore, we get 4/4=1 at the farthest point, then 3/4, 2/4, and 1/4 for intermediate points. Finally 0 when we are at the goal state.\n",

    "- **h5:** This heuristic **_is admissible_**. It is a combination of h1 and h4 and perfectly describes the situation mentioned when analysing h1. It considers both the blocking cars and the distance to the exit. And because blocking cars have more weight than moving closer to the exit, the heuristic will prioritize that. Once all the cars are out of the way, this heuristic will allow us to instantly find the solution, unlike h1, h2, and h3. "

With **Uniform Cost Search** often having the largest search path and **Greedy Best First Search** often having the smallest. This falls in line with our expectations, as Uniform Cost Search systematically checks all low cost solution paths, even if they do not yield a solution. In addition, both Uniform Cost Search and Algorithm A/A* also reinsert certain nodes if the new cost is smaller, which means the algorithm could search the same node several times.
